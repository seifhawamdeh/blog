        Hi! I'm Jamie Carter, a full-stack engineer currently building thoughtful
        products at a remote-first startup. I love working across the stack, from
        the design of collaborative user experiences down to the nitty-gritty of
        API design and developer tooling.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is my corner of the internet where I share what I'm learning,
        publish notes from talks, and document experiments that teach me
        something new. I try to publish every few weeks and focus on approachable
        writing that other curious builders can enjoy.
      </p>
      <h2>What I'm excited about</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Developer experience and tools that empower small teams</li>
        <li>Design systems and thoughtful interfaces</li>
        <li>Open source communities and sustainable contribution models</li>
        <li>Running, analog photography, and third-wave coffee</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
