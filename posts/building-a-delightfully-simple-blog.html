      <p>
        When I decided to give my personal site a refresh, I wanted to avoid the
        trap of spending weeks fiddling with frameworks and build pipelines. I
        needed something that felt lightweight, fast to maintain, and pleasant
        for readers. That meant embracing good old-fashioned static HTML, a dash
        of CSS, and a sprinkle of progressive enhancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is what you're reading now—a handcrafted blog that renders
        almost instantly and is easy to publish to any static host. Here are a
        few guiding principles I followed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimize for writing, not configuration.</li>
        <li>Use design tokens to keep styling consistent.</li>
        <li>Ship accessible, semantic markup by default.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Content structure</h2>
      <p>
        Posts live in individual HTML files so they can be authored in any text
        editor. A tiny JavaScript file powers the homepage list and formats
        dates, but everything still works with scripting disabled.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Simple tools are boring in the best way possible—they stay out of the
        way so you can focus on the work that matters.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Going forward I plan to add RSS and a projects page, but this version is
        intentionally minimal. Shipping now means I can iterate with real
        feedback instead of polishing in private.
