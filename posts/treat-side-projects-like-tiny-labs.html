        Every time I burn out on a side project it's because I tried to build a
        fully-fledged product in one go. The antidote has been thinking about my
        projects like miniature labs, each focused on a single hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of asking “how do I launch this?” I ask “what can I learn this
        week?” That tiny shift keeps momentum high and expectations realistic.
      </p>
      <h2>My favorite experiments</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Ship a landing page and measure who signs up for updates.</li>
        <li>Prototype the riskiest feature in a notebook or Figma.</li>
        <li>Write a blog post explaining the idea to clarify scope.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Running experiments creates feedback loops that either validate the
        project or nudge me toward better ideas. No experiment is a failure if it
        teaches me something about what to build next.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the next time you're tempted to start another sprawling side
        project, give the tiny lab approach a try. You'll ship more, learn
        faster, and have a lot more fun along the way.
