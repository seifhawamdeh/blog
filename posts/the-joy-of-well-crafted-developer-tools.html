        Great developer tools feel like a teammate who anticipates your next
        question. They guide you gently toward success, protect you from sharp
        edges, and make the craft of building software a little more joyful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I've collected a few hallmarks of excellent tooling:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarity in documentation and in-product guidance.</li>
        <li>Fast feedback loops that keep you in flow.</li>
        <li>APIs designed with empathy for the humans who use them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When we invest in these qualities, we reduce onboarding time, increase
        confidence in deployments, and give teams space to innovate. It's not
        just about productivity metrics—it's about creating environments where
        engineers can do their best work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're building tools for developers, take time to dogfood early and
        often. Watch how people use your product, observe where they hesitate,
        and polish the little moments. That's where delight lives.
